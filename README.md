Bit Shifter's Monitor for the MEGA65.

![Monitor](https://github.com/MEGA65/mega65-rom-monitor/blob/main/pictures/monitor.png)

This monitor is a open source replacement for the C65 monitor.

It supports many features of the 45GS02 CPU and the linear address modes,
which enables access to the full 28 bit space of ROM, RAM and I/O.

A full documentation is in progress as chapter in the MEGA65 User's Guide.

The source code can be assembled with the BSA assembler
